# Open5GS Proofs of Concept

Each PoC will be stored in a specific directory. For the beginners, it is recommendable to start with the installation guide and basic example execution steps included in Open5GS web page: https://open5gs.org/open5gs/docs/. List of available PoCs in this repository:
- Open5GS Network Slicing, Edge Computing PoC: https://github.com/chemadh/5GC_PoCs/tree/main/Open5GS_PoCs/Network%20slicing%2C%20edge%20computing
