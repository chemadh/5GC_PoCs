# Proofs of concept configurations for open-source 5GCs

The technology disruption driven by 5G standards justifies the necessity of environments where practical implementation and review of the advanced set of functionalities introduced. Additionally, some of the 5G functionalities requires a high level of abstraction that is difficult to achieve without a practical view.

On this regard, there are two open-source implementations of 5G Core that could be uses as basis for these Proofs of Concepts: Free5GC (https://www.free5gc.org/) and Open5GS (https://open5gs.org/). This repository organize the available examples in one subdirectory for each initiative
