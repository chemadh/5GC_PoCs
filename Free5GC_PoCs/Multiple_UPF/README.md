# Multiple UPF PoC

The objective of this PoC is demonstrating the following 5G functionalities using the Free5GC implementation:
-	Split of user and control plane functions in different VMs and physical hosts. It demonstrates the possibility of using dedicated resources to each type of traffic.
-	Definition of one I-UPF to act as an Uplink Classifier. 
-	Alignment of UERANSIM, UDM and SMF configuration to enable two Data Networks: Internet and IMS. The uplink classifier will address different UPFs to connect with each DN.
-	Split of access and 5GC in different environments interconnected via the VXLAN overlay network.
The overall concept is described in the next diagram:

## Detail of resources deployed in the test bench to enable this configuration
-	First Free5GC VM: It runs all 5GC nodes, except UPF, to handle all control plane functions.
-	Second Free5GC VM: instance containing UPF that handles Internet DN.
-	Third Free5GC VM: instance containing UPF that handles IMS DN.
-	Fourth Free5GC VM: It runs the I-UPF acting as Uplink Classifier. It connects the user plane with UERANSIM gNB in one side, and Internet or IMS dedicated UPFs, depending on the DN traffic.

## Additional elements required to build the PoC
-	UERANSIM LxC instance to simulate the access network (gNB) and UE.
-	LxC instance to simulate the Internet Gateway function (simple Linux VM)
-	LxC instance to simulate the IMS node (simple Linux VM)

	- UERANSIM in VPS1 physical node (VPS cluster)
	- Free5GC - control plane: lserver1 physical node (local cluster)
	- Free5GC - UPFs: lserver2 physical node (local cluster)
	- LxCs internet gateway y IMS, lserver3 physical node (local cluster)

- Global reconfiguration of startup script in each Free5G VM (run.sh):
	- For VMs running only UPF, removal of parts of the script dedicated to launch the rest of 5GC elements (complete file in https://github.com/chemadh/5GC_PoCs/tree/main/Free5GC_PoCs/Multiple_UPF/config_files/free5gc02/run_only_upf.sh).
	- For VM running only the control plane, removal of parts of the script dedicated to launch the UPF. (complete file in https://github.com/chemadh/5GC_PoCs/tree/main/Free5GC_PoCs/Multiple_UPF/config_files/free5gc/run.sh).
- Update of 5GC subscription information (UDM web UI): Update of one of the UEs to define two DNNs: Internet and IMS. A capture of the resulting change in the web UI can be seen below:

<img src="./capture_02.PNG" title="./capture_02.PNG" width=400px></img>

- Update of UERANSIM: 
	- Update of gNB configuration file to configure N2 NGAP interface to interact with AMF LAN IP (complete file in https://github.com/chemadh/5GC_PoCs/tree/main/Free5GC_PoCs/Multiple_UPF/config_files/ueransim/free5gc-gnb.sh).
	- Update of UE configuration file to define both Internet and IMS DNNs (complete file in https://github.com/chemadh/5GC_PoCs/tree/main/Free5GC_PoCs/Multiple_UPF/config_files/ueransim/free5gc-ue.sh).

## Tests done:
Once all Free5GC and UERANSIM components are running (using their respectively updated run.sh and run_only_upf.sh startup scripts), it can be checked that UERANSIM node has raised two GTP tunnels with I-UPF, one for Internet DNN and other for IMS DNN. UERANSIM startup example:
```
cd UERANSIM
build/nr-gnb -c config/free5gc-gnb.yaml
sudo build/nr-ue -c config/free5gc-ue.yaml
```
Connectivity tests (i.e. ping with tcpdump traffic validation) can be done to verify that:
-	Traffic connecting with Internet Gateway and using GTP interface associated to Internet DNN in UE, follows the user plane path gNB â€“ i-UPF â€“ Internet UPF â€“ Internet Gateway LxC. Example ping command:
```
sudo ping 192.168.8.115 -I uesimtun0
```
-	Traffic connecting with IMS node and using GTP interface associated to IMS DNN in UE, follows the user plane path gNB â€“ i-UPF â€“ IMS UPF â€“ IMS LxC. Example ping command:
```
sudo ping 192.168.8.116 -I uesimtun1
```
Note: please follow all the environment preparation instructions described in Free5GC basic setup guides: enable ip forwarding, setup NAT for traffic plane interfaces and stop firewall:
```
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ens18 -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -I FORWARD 1 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I INPUT -i upfgtp -j ACCEPT
sudo systemctl stop ufw
```
## Possible further improvements:
In addition to the present PoC definition, the following improvements that can be identified for further activities (out of the scope of the present Master Thesis):
1.	Deployment of Kamailo IMS (included since Kamailio 4.0) in IMS LxC instance.
2.	Deployment of a second URANSIM with an additional UE, using also both Internet and IMS DNs. 
3.	Configuration of a SIP phone in each UERANSIM LxC instance, to register two users in Kamailio IMS once the UEs are registered and IMS data session are set up.
4.	Call example between the two UEs.
